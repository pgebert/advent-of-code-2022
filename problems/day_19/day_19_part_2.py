--- Part Two ---
Sometimes, it's a good idea to appreciate just how big the ocean is. Using the Manhattan distance, how far apart do the scanners get?

In the above example, scanners 2 (1105,-1205,1229) and 3 (-92,-2380,-20) are the largest Manhattan distance apart. In total, they are 1197 + 1175 + 1249 = 3621 units apart.

What is the largest Manhattan distance between any two scanners?
